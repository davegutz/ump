ump
===

   Monitor dual video capture card, segment captured images to detect
moving balls, and predict whether balls intersect strike zone.


Dependencies
============

   System V IPC, pthread, Image Magic, GIMP, bttv, and (2) PCI BT8x8
frame grabber cards.


Installation
============

   For installation of the program, see INSTALL.

   The program was developed under RH 6.1 but later updated
to RHEL 3.0 kernel 4-21.  It no longer runs under RH 6.1 and
also will not run on early versions of kernel 4 before the 
pthread library was improved.  You should run kernel 4-21 or later.

   The GIMP and Image Magic need to be installed when running ump.

   The module bttv needs to be running when ump does. With RHEL this
requires recompiling the kernel (sorry).  Remember to use kernel 4-21
or later.  For the menuconfig settings I used:

     Video for Linux
        [*]Video for Linux
           [*]v4l proc
           [M]bt848
     
     Character devices
         [*]i2c
         [*]i2c bit banging

     Main
         [*]systemV IPC


   In /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit I added:

      # Turn on video devices
      modprobe bttv >/dev/null 2>&1


   For help installing cameras and cards, you are on your own.  For help
calibrating cameras and locating them there is help and scripts installed
by the program.  See the info file:

     info ump

that will tell you how to run the checkSetup script interactively.



Documentation
=============

   Run info for documentaion:


     info ump


   Sometimes it is necessary to add texinfo.tex by running 'automake
--add-missing' from the top level ump-ver directory.

   Then go to doc directory.  'make ump.info'.  Re-run 'make install'.
View the ".info" file with:

     info ump


Optional Lights
===============

Optionally you can connect indicator light circuits to the lpt printer port for indication of pitch result.   Presently Ump turns on pins 2, 3, and 4 for BALL, STRIKE, and NO CALL respectively.  Pins 2-9 are controlled by values of 1, 2, 4, 8,...128. Pins 18 - 25 are grounds. Pins 1,14,16, & 17 are 5 vdc sources. Use low current LEDs (2 mA) and drop a resistor so no more than 2.6 mA is drawn at 2.4 vdc total drop.
